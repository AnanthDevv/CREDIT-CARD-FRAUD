This fraudulent activity involves the unauthorized purchase of goods or cash advances on the victim's credit card.

As technology advances, cyber criminals increasingly leverage digital methods to obtain credit card details, making it a prevalent concern in today's digital age.

In the digital age, predictive modeling emerges as a powerful tool to combat this menace. Predictive modeling solution leverages data analysis to anticipate and prevent fraudulent activities, offering a proactive defense against unauthorized credit card transactions.

By analyzing historical data and discerning patterns, predictive modeling methods can predict future events, such as potential instances of credit card fraud. Its effectiveness in identifying and thwarting fraudulent activities has made it a cornerstone in the ongoing battle to secure financial transactions and protect cardholders from the perils of fraud.

Credit card fraud detection involves the adoption of policies, tools, methodologies, and practices by credit card companies and banking or financial institutions to combat fraudulent transactions.
